# Pomodoro Timer
An application developed in React Native that helps in the implementation of Pomodoro time management technique.

# Description
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique consists of using a stopwatch to divide the work into 25-minute periods, separated by brief intervals. This app helps in its implementation. The application starts with a countdown of 25 minutes of total focus, when it reaches the end it plays an audible warning and starts the countdown of 5 minutes of rest, thus changing the count during its use.

# Technologies
The project is all constructed with React Native and the Expo toolchain.
